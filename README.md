Offered by the Finance and Analytics Club at IIT Kanpur, this project aimed to develop a quantitative trading model from scratch and gain a comprehensive understanding of various financial tests and terms. The approach involved examining key financial metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted returns, Z Scores for statistical significance of price deviations, and moving averages for trend identification. The project also included analyzing pairs of stationary and non-stationary time series data using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to determine stationarity, which is crucial for implementing a mean reversion strategy. This strategy assumes that prices will revert to their mean over time, enabling profitable trades during deviations. By coupling the mean reversion strategy with intra-day trading techniques and thoroughly backtesting it on historical data, the model achieved an impressive annual return of 75%. This project demonstrates the effective application of quantitative trading principles to capture profitable trading opportunities and manage risk.
